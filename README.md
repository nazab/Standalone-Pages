# WordPress Plugin Standalone Pages

An easy way to deploy standalone pages by just uploading new pages template files.

## Features

* Automaticly create WordPress pages for each "standalone template" present in the curent theme.
* Does not override any changes to the "standalone page" made in the admin. Like Page title, or Hierarchy.

## Usage


1. Copy the `standalon-pages` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "Standalon pages"
4. Click on "Activate"

This will activate the WordPress Plugin Standalone Pages and create the missing standalone page.
